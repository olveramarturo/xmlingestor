# xmlingestor
Python tool to ingest an XML and extract tag values as dictionary entries

Although other XMl processors exist, this is a tool to pull only specific tags out of an XML dropping unnecesary data and levels. An example of this would be processing a google maps file to get just location and coordinates.
